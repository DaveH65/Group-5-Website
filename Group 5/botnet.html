    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>A botnet is an internet of internet-connected devices that have been infected with malicious 
            software by hackers, so that they can control these devices without permission and 
            knowledge of their owners. It is used by criminal hacker groups to steal data from the 
            organizations. It is also used to flood the internet with spam, by sending phishing emails and 
            tricking victims to get their personal information.</p>
