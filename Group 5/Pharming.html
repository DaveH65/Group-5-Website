<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>One of the more dangerous forms of social engineering is pharming because you are being tricked into putting your 
	information unknowingly that it is a scam. How does pharming actually work? According to the article, “What 
	is Pharming and how to Protect d how to Protect Yourself”, First a malicious code is sent by email by the 
	hacker to install a virus or a trojan. This virus then directs traffic away from intended websites and towards 
	fake websites instead. Through these fake websites the hacker is able to steal personal and financial information 
	from the users. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Example of a Pharming Attack</h3>
    <p>Pharming is almost like phishing “but without the lure”. Pharming tricks you into putting 
	your login information into a site sending it straight to the attacker by having a similar login page to the site 
	you are trying to log in on. Jones goes on to describe a huge pharming attack that was done with British Airways. 
	They had poor security systems and therefore, they were able to trick over 500,000 customers to give them their 
	financial information. They blamed the poor security system for this and were very largely fined. Pharming is unique 
	in the way they attack people because they have built trust through other websites. According to another article 
	“Phishing, Pharming and Social Engineering Attacks”, pharming is more of web traffic from an actual site to a fake 
	destination. Keeping safe from these types of threats are a little bit harder because they are not easy to detect. 
	Trusting and making sure these websites and companies have a good security system is key to keeping safe from these attacks.</p>
