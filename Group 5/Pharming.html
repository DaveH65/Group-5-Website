<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>One of the more dangerous forms of social engineering is pharming because you are being tricked into putting your information unknowingly that it is a scam. How does pharming actually work? According to the article, “What is Pharming and how to Protect d how to Protect Yourself”, First a malicious code is sent by email by the hacker to install a virus or a trojan. This virus then directs traffic away from intended websites and towards fake websites instead. Through these fake websites the hacker is able to steal personal and financial information from the users. 
According to the article “Phishing, Vishing, Smishing, Whaling and Pharming: How to Stop Social Engineering Attacks”, pharming is almost like phishing “but without the lure”. Pharming tricks you into putting your login information into a site sending it straight to the attacker by having a similar login page to the site you are trying to log in on. Jones goes on to describe a huge pharming attack that was done with British Airways. They had poor security systems and therefore, they were able to trick over 500,000 customers to give them their financial information. They blamed the poor security system for this and were very largely fined. Pharming is unique in the way they attack people because they have built trust through other websites. 
	According to another article “Phishing, Pharming and Social Engineering Attacks”, pharming is more of web traffic from an actual site to a fake destination. Keeping safe from these types of threats are a little bit harder because they are not easy to detect. Trusting and making sure these websites and companies have a good security system is key to keeping safe from these attacks.<p>
