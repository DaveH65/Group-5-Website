    <h2>Introduction</h1>
    <p>A remote access trojan is a technique employed by malicious people in order to gain access to someone’s 
        Computer. RATs may be transmitted via seemingly ordinary emails or some other medium in which a user
        Interacts with it. What the RATs do is set up a command and control center where the user’s server is sending
        Commands to the RAT and the data are sent to the attacker. They are incredibly similar to  Remote System 
        Administration tools in that they have the ability to see and interact with the victim’s computer, but they 
        obviously do this without the consent of the victim (TechT).</p>
<br>
<h3>How Do RAT's Attack?</h3>
<p> They can infect computers via email, suspicious websites, and by exploiting a weakness in a computer.(Check) Once the attacker infects the computer via the above-mentioned methods the RAT sets up a C2 channel, which allows for bidirectional communication between the attacker and the victim's computer. Once this occurs the attacker is able to gain complete access to the victim's computer, and employ whatever functionality it wants to.(Geek)

        <h4>Example of a RAT Attack</h2>
        <p>Trojan Dropper: Where the trojan delivers malicious code to a device.</p>
        <p>Spyware: Takes information from personal accounts, such as social media, banking details etc. </p>
        <p>In 2017 a ransomware attack by the name of "WannaCry" infected about 230,000 computers and the perpetrators requested a ransom payment of $600 worth in bitcoins or else their files would be permanently delted. The RAT used was DoublePulsar coupled with EternalBlue to create a backdoor and spread the virus. This could have been avoided if the companies/individuals updated the new Microsoft windows update.(Cry)   </p>
