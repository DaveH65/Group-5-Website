    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>A zero-day attack is the use of a zero-day exploit to cause damage to or steal 
        data from a system affected by vulnerability. Software often has security 
        funnels that hackers exploit to create havoc. Software developers look for 
        funnels that need to be "patched." But some hackers will find these 
        vulnerabilities before these software developers, and then write and 
        implement code to exploit it, which is called exploit code. Software users can 
        become victims through identity theft or other forms of cybercrime. When 
        vulnerabilities are known, developers try to patch them to prevent attacks. 
        However, security breaches are usually not immediately discovered. It can 
        sometimes take days, weeks, or even months for developers to identify the 
        vulnerability that led to an attack.</p>

    <p>In the first half of 2014, te growth of zero-day attacks continued unabated 
       compared 2013. Unsurprisinglt, all zero-day attacks targeted end-user application
       such as Microsoft Office Typically, theses attacks are launched using classic 
       spear-phishing tactics. Althought Microsoft Internet Explorer is the most
       patched product on the market, it is also the most exploited, surpasing Oracle 
       java and Adobe Flash. By contrast, Java had no reported zero-day vulnerabilities 
       in the first half of 2014.</P>
