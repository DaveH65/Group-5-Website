    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>A remote access trojan is a technique employed by malicious people in order to gain access to someone’s 
        Computer. RATs may be transmitted via seemingly ordinary emails or some other medium in which a user
        Interacts with it. What the RATs do is set up a command and control center where the user’s server is sending
        Commands to the RAT and the data are sent to the attacker. They are incredibly similar to the remote system 
        Administration tools in that they have the ability to see and interact with the victim’s computer, but they 
        obviously do this without the consent of the victim.</p>
