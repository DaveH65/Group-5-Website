    <h1>Introduction</h1>\
    <p>Before  learning  what  a  port  scan  is,  it  is  important  to  understand  what  a  port  is.  A  port  is  a  point  on  a 
        computer system where information exchange between multiple programs and the internet to devices or 
        other computers takes place. Ports are assigned numbers to ensure consistency. These 
        ports  can  be  scanned  though,  which  is  a  popular  technique  used  by  hackers  to  find  weak  points  in  a 
        network. By doing this and locating weak points, hackers can then exploit these weaknesses for their own 
        personal  gain.  This  can  be  combatted  however  through  a  strong  security  system,  which  can  prevent 
        unauthorized  access  to  a  businessâ€™s  private  network,  and  uncovering  network  holes,  which  is  when 
        businesses run port scans on themselves to see if there are any weak points on their networks. </p>
