    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Being online has many risks but also many rewards. One has access to essentially all information that exists on the planet that
        can be used for whatever purpose they see fit. However, with the good, comes the bad. Being able to access all these websites
        comes with the risk of being hacked by individuals who are looking to gain access to your own personal information. One of the
        types of hacking that someone can take part in is a port scan.</p>
<br>
<h3>What is a Port Scan?</h3>
<p> Before  learning  what  a  port  scan  is,  it  is  important  to  understand  what  a  port  is.  A  port  is  a  point  on  a 
    computer system where information exchange between multiple programs and the internet to devices or 
    other computers takes place. Ports are assigned numbers to ensure consistency. These 
    ports  can  be  scanned  though,  which  is  a  popular  technique  used  by  hackers  to  find  weak  points  in  a 
    network. By doing this and locating weak points, hackers can then exploit these weaknesses for their own 
    personal  gain.  This  can  be  combatted  however  through  a  strong  security  system,  which  can  prevent 
    unauthorized  access  to  a  business’s  private  network,  and  uncovering  network  holes,  which  is  when 
    businesses run port scans on themselves to see if there are any weak points on their networks.</p>
<br>
<br>
        <h4>Effect on Individuals</h4>
        <p>This unauthorized use of computers onto unsuspecting individuals is something that extremely affects its victims. Most times,
            the data breach is not found out about until after a few weeks or months after the original data breach takes place. This
            information gained by the hackers can be used to steal personal information which can then be exploited for financial gain.
            The information stolen can be used to take money out of accounts, open credit cards, file tax returns, make health insurance
            claims, and even more without your consent, all of which the individual is financially liable for.</p>
