    <h1 class="DEVTITLE">Common Modes of Attacks</h1>
    <BYLINE>Editor:<em> Jasmine Monreal</em></BYLINE>

    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h1>
    <p>There are two different types of Common Modes of attacks there are passive and active attacks.
Passive attacks are when hackers have multiple copies of the content and can observe your content. The person experiencing the attack will never notice and find out about the attack. Active attacks are when the hacker has accessed content and modified it. This can cause damage to your devices and the material the hacker has access to. You will know when you experienced an active attack because you will be notified about the attack once the damage is done.
.</p>
<br>
<h3>Examples of Active Attacks</h3>
<p> Examples of Active attacks are Masquerade attacks, Session hijacking attacks, and DOS attacks. These active attacks are aggressive and highly malicious. These attacks are used to gather information, destroy files, or gain access. “Masquerade attacks are the most common types of active attacks These attacks are when the hacker gains access by stealing login identifications or finding security gaps”(Contributor, TechTarget. “What Is an Active Attack? - Definition from Whatis.com.” WhatIs.com, TechTarget, 30 June 2021,). Another attack is Session hijacking is when a hacker uses a vulnerable part of a network or computer and uses it as an advantage to gain access to documents and data by impersonating a user. 
</p>

        <h4>What are Passive Attacks? </h2>
        <p>Passive attacks can be considered spyware. Examples of these types of attacks are tapping, encryption, and scanning. “Tapping is when you are being monitored such as through emails or telephone calls” (4 Examples of a Passive Attack.” Simplicable,). Scanning is when is connected to Wi-Fi and can be scanned and looked at for weak opens in the system that is connected to the Wi-Fi and can be manipulated to gain access. </p>
<br>
<h4>How to Avoid Passive and Active Attacks</h4>
<p>There are ways to avoid passive and active attacks, such as encrypting your network. This can be done by getting a VPN or “a powerful firewall that can prevent and protect you from active attacks” (“Active and Passive Attacks: Differences and Prevention.” Internet Security Tips, 10 July 2020,). It is better to prepare to prevent these attacks from happening to you.  </p>
<br>
<h4>In Conculsion</h4> 
<p>There are different types of attacks, but they are all harmful and can make you feel exposed. Both active and passive attacks are dangerous and result in harming you and your information. Prevention is the key to helping prevent these attacks from happening. </p>
