    <h1>Botnet</h1>
    
    <BYLINE>Editor:<em> Shiori Oizumi</em></BYLINE>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>A botnet is a network of private computers infected with malicious software and controlled as a group without the owners' knowledge.
        These computers that do get hacked, which are then known as "bots," as used to perform tasks, without the consent of the owners of
        the computers.</p>
    <p>Botnets are typically created by infecting a large number of computers with a piece of malware that allows the attacker to control
        it remotely. One's computer can become a "bot" in a variety of ways, including email attachments, fake updates, or drive-by-downloads
        Once the computers become infected and become bots, they are controlled by a command anad control (C&C) server, which instructs the bots
        and recieves the information from the bot.</p>
<br>
<h3>What are Botnets used for?</h3>
<p>Botnets are mainly used for a variety of unethical and unlawful activities. Some of these activities include sending spam emails,
    spreading malware, or launching DDoS attacks. While not illegal, spam emails are an annoyance that no one wants, with our inbox
    being flooded with unwanted and unappreciated messages. Malware, on the other hand, has the potential to cause serious damage to
    our personal and work computers, such as stealing personal information and possibly holding that information for ransom against
    the user. DDoS attacks have the potential to completey shut down online servers with flooding the website with bots</p>
<p>One of the key advantages of botnets is their sheer size and distributed nature. A large botnet can consist of up to millions of
     bots, making it a strong asset for the hacker trying to gain information. Furthermore, the bots are able to spread across the
     globe, making it even harder for law enforcement to crack down on this technique. Also, given the fact that these bots can and
     do communicate with the C&C server using encrypted channels, it is harder than before.</p>
<br>
<br>
        <h4>Effects on Individuals and Organizations</h4>
        <p>Botnets are a major threat to individuals and organizations alike. They can cause financial losses, damage to someone's
            reputation if they are the one who gets hacked, and loss of sensitive data. Therefore, it is imperative that individuals
            take action to protect themselves from this hacking. One of the actions that the everyday person or business can do is stay
            up to date on our software, which can be updated with better online security features. Another action that one can do is avoid
            opening suspicious emails or links, as these links can be what is used to transform your computers into a bot. Finally, make sure
            to use a reputable antivirus program. It is important to note that if you see anything suspicious happening, contact the appropriate
            authorities who can step in and take action.</p>
